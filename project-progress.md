 # AcLab Advancement

## - 19 Octobre -

```
    Today was dedicated to basic choices around the project, subject, tools,
    means of communication...
    
    We've created a Github repo, a discord server to communicate and a Trello 
    Board to organize tasks.
    
    Concerning the subject we decided to make a mobile app that helps you
    and your friends (if you have some) to choose the movie of your evening/party.
    We've discussed about wether we want to do it using react-native or in flutter
